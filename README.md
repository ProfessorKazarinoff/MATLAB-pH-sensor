# MATLAB to Arduino pH Sensor
A student project for ENGR114 at Portland Community College. Uses MATLAB connected to an Arudino over serial to read a pH sensor

## Problem Statement
The team was required to build the hardware and code to control a pH sensor, in order to
measure the pH of the water in a fish tank water.
We had to complete the following tasks to achieve our final goal:
1. Build the hardware.
2. Connect the hardware to Arduino.
3. Read the Arduino code in MATLAB.
4. Modify the codes to:
  i. Measure the pH in real time, within the time limit set by the user.
  ii. Record the data, and produce a plot of pH against time.
5. Refine collected data by conducting multiples tests, putting the sensor in solutions of
different pH, collecting the resulting data, and producing a plot corresponding to the data.
(Steps listed above appear a lot easier than they actually are.)
